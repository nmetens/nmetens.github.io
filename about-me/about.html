        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <section class="about-me">
            <p>Hello! My name is Nathan. I began college at the age of 16 thanks to a generous program called Early College High School (ECHS). This program allowed me to be a full-time student at Portland Community College (PCC). I graduated from ECHS at the top of my class with an associate of science degree and transferred to Portland State University (PSU). There, I graduated with a Bachelor's in mathematics, with minors in physics and computer science. I became interested in computer programming after a coding class where I learned the basics of the Python language. I have been learning to program for the last two years and find it captivating each time I acquire new knowledge. Thus, I am currently taking courses towards a master's in computer science at PSU, from which I plan to graduate sometime in 2022. <br> <br>
            Aside from sitting at my desk all day, I enjoy cycling, running, playing basketball, traveling, backpacking, and cliff jumping. I love staying active through outdoor adventures and working out. A fun fact about me is that I am a first-generation Belgian-American (the french-speaking kind).</p>
