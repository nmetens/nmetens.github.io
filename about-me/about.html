            Hello! My name is Nathan. I began college at the age of 16 at Portland Community College thanks to a generous program called Early College High School (ECHS). I graduated with my bachelor's degree from Portland State University (PSU) at age 20 in the Spring of 2021 with a degree in mathematics and minors in physics and computer science. I am now taking classes towards my master's in computer science at PSU, from which I hope to graduate sometime in 2022. <br><br>
            Aside from sitting at my desk all day, some of my hobbies are cycling, running, playing basketball, backpacking, and more.

            Hello! My name is Nathan. I began college at the age of 16 thanks to a generous program called Early College High School (ECHS). This program allowed me to be a full-time student at Portland Community College (PCC). For two years, I studied the basics of math, physics, and chemistry. I graduated from ECHS at the top of my class with an associate of science degree and transferred to Portland State University (PSU). There, I pursued a bachelor's in mathematics, a minor in physics, and a minor in computer science. I graduated with my bachelor's degree at age 20 in the Spring of 2021. <br><br>
            I grew interested in computer programming after a coding class where I learned the basics of the Python language last spring 2020. I find it captivating each time I acquire new computer knowledge. Thus, I am currently taking courses towards a master's in computer science at PSU, from which I plan to graduate sometime in 2022. I also plan to be a math tutor and computer science tutor while completing my master's. <br><br>
            I am currently the co-manager of a small family business called Oofty Waffles and Crepes and was a lifeguard for a year at the local aquatic center (check out my previous work page). <br><br>
            Aside from sitting at my desk all day, I enjoy cycling, running, playing basketball, traveling the world, backpacking, cliff jumping, drawing, skydiving, and more. I love staying active through outdoor adventures and working out. A fun fact about me is that I am a first-generation Belgian-American (the french-speaking kind). <br><br>
